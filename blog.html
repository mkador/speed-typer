                <h6>The difference is that while data in localStorage doesn't expire, data in sessionStorage is cleared when the page session ends.Whenever a document is loaded in a particular tab in the browser, a unique page session gets created and assigned to that particular tab.

                    Global scope contains all of the things defined outside of all code blocks. A code block simply consists of grouped statements inside curly braces ({ }). if statement, loops, function are examples of structure that create a code block. A global variable has global scope. A global variable is accessible from anywhere in the code.

                    The Event Loop has one simple job — to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the Call Stack is empty, the Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call Stack, which effectively runs it. Such an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop.

                    The event loop is the secret behind JavaScript’s asynchronous programming. JS executes all operations on a single thread, but using a few smart data structures, it gives us the illusion of multi-threading. Let’s take a look at what happens on the back-end.
                    The call stack is responsible for keeping track of all the operations in line to be executed. Whenever a function is finished, it is popped from the stack.
                    The event queue is responsible for sending new functions to the stack for processing. It follows the queue data structure to maintain the correct sequence in which all operations should be sent for execution.
                    
                    Whenever an async function is called, it is sent to a browser API. These are APIs built into the browser. Based on the command received from the call stack, the API starts its own single-threaded operation.

                <h6>undefined</h6>
                  <p>Undefined is also a primitive value in JavaScript. A variable or an object has an undefined value when no value is assigned before using it. So you can say that undefined means lack of value or unknown value.</p>
                  <ul><li>
                    primitive value is used when a variable has not been assigned a value
                  </li>
                <li>
                  A declared variable but not yet assigned with a value (uninitialized) is by default undefined
                </li>
              <li>
                When accessing a non-existing object property, JavaScript returns undefined
              </li>
            <li>
              The function parameters implicitly default to undefined
            </li>
          <li>
            Implicitly, without return statement, a JavaScript function returns undefined
          </li>
        <li>
          undefined represents the value of a variable that hasn't been yet initialized, while null represents an intentional absence of an object
